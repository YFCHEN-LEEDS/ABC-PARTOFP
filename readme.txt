This is a model based on Bee coloney optimization algorithm which was inspired by some of the 
behaivor of bees, and it is specialized to solve the TSP(Travelling salesman problem) without going
back to the starting point.
        
It haven't based on any project that already exist and it was just based on the idea
of BCO so it might very different from others who want to solve the similar problem.
        
We will compare the performance of this model with seval other Bio inspired methodwhich focuse on the same problem


Important Notice:
	1. It runs the map store in the txt file by default.
		If you want to get a random map just go to line 316 to change use the random coords
		that has been comment out. Looks like following
	#----------------------------------Change the Coords here !!!----------------------------------------------
	coords = get_city_map("my_array.txt")
	#coords = np.random.randint(max_distance, size=(number_of_cities, 2))
	#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	2. Sometimes this algorithm will fall into a local optimal solution, please restart the hive (rerun this program directly).

	3. Sometime when rerun the code it can not display the final fitness graph, please just clear the output, stop and restart the code.
